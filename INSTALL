libiptcdata
===========

REQUIREMENTS
------------

libiptcdata is written in portable C code and has no prerequisite
libraries.  It has been tested under GNU/Linux.

INSTALLATION
------------

first run:

  ./configure
  make

and as root:

  make install


Note: On Mac OS X, it has been reported that internationalization support
in libiptcdata is often disabled at configure time because the libintl
library cannot be found.  If you use a package installer such as Fink
or DarwinPorts, you can obtain libintl by installing the gettext package and
then running libiptcdata's configure script as:
  ./configure --with-libintl-prefix=/sw --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw
for Fink, or:
  ./configure --with-libintl-prefix=/opt/local --with-libiconv-prefix=/opt/local
for DarwinPorts.
