libiptcdata
===========

REQUIREMENTS
------------

libiptcdata is written in portable C code and has no prerequisite
libraries.  It has been tested under GNU/Linux.

INSTALLATION
------------

first run:

  ./configure
  make

and as root:

  make install


Note: On Mac OS X, it has been reported that internationalization support
in libiptcdata is often disabled at configure time because the libintl
library cannot be found.  However, this can usually be remedied by pointing
the configure script at the true location of libintl by invocing it like
this:
  ./configure --with-libintl-prefix=/sw --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw
