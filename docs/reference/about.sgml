	<title>What is libiptcdata?</title>

	<para>
	 libiptcdata is a library for manipulating the International Press
	 Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata stored within multimedia
	 files such as images.  The library provides routines for parsing,
	 viewing, modifying, and saving this metadata.  The library is licensed
	 under the GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL).
	</para>

	<para>
	 It was written by David Moore and is meant as a companion to the
	 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif">libexif library</ulink>,
	 forming
	 a complete set of tools for manipulating image metadata.

	<title>Compiling libiptcdata</title>

	<para>
        On UNIX, libiptcdata uses the standard GNU build system,
        using <application>autoconf</application> for package
        configuration and resolving portability issues,
        <application>automake</application> for building makefiles
        that comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
        <application>libtool</application> for building shared
        libraries on multiple platforms.  The normal sequence for
        compiling and installing the GLib library is thus:

        <literallayout>
          <userinput>./configure</userinput>
          <userinput>make</userinput>
          <userinput>make install</userinput>
        </literallayout>
      </para>

      <note>
        <title>Compiling on Mac OS X</title>
	<para>
	  On Mac OS X, it has been reported that internationalization support
	  in libiptcdata is often disabled at configure time because the
	  libintl library cannot be found.  However, this can usually be
	  remedied by pointing the configure script at the true location of
	  libintl by invoking it like this:
	  <literallayout>
	    <userinput>./configure --with-libintl-prefix=/sw --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw</userinput>
	  </literallayout>
	</para>

	<title>The iptc command-line utility</title>

	<para>
	 libiptcdata ships with a companion utility, <application>iptc</application>,
	 which provides a command-line interface for viewing and modifying the IPTC
	 data of a JPEG file.  Its usage is as follows:

	 <programlisting>
Utility for viewing and modifying the contents of IPTC metadata in images

Usage: iptc [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

Examples:
  iptc image.jpg       # display the IPTC metadata contained in image.jpg
  iptc -m Caption -v "Foo" *.jpg
                       # set caption "Foo" in all jpegs of the curr. dir.
  iptc -a Keywords -v "vacation" *.jpg
                       # add keyword "vacation" to all jpegs

Operations:
  -a, --add=TAG        add new tag with identifier TAG
  -m, --modify=TAG     modify tag with identifier TAG (add if not present)
  -v, --value=VALUE    value for added/modified tag
  -d, --delete=TAG     delete tag with identifier TAG
  -p, --print=TAG      print value of tag with identifier TAG

Options:
  -q, --quiet          produce less verbose output
  -b, --backup         backup any modified files
  -s, --sort           sort tags before displaying or saving

Informative output:
  -l, --list           list the names of all known tags (i.e. Caption, etc.)
  -L, --list-desc=TAG  print the name and description of TAG
      --help           print this help, then exit
      --version        print iptc program version number, then exit
	 </programlisting>

	 The source code of iptc also serves as a reference for writing other
	 applications that use libiptcdata.
