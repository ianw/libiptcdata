	<title>What is libiptcdata?</title>

	<para>
	 libiptcdata is a library for manipulating the International Press
	 Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata stored within multimedia
	 files such as images.  The library provides routines for parsing,
	 viewing, modifying, and saving this metadata.  The library is licensed
	 under the GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL).
	</para>

	<para>
	 It was written by David Moore and is meant as a companion to the
	 <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif">libexif library</ulink>,
	 forming
	 a complete set of tools for manipulating image metadata.

	<title>Compiling libiptcdata</title>

	<para>
        On UNIX, libiptcdata uses the standard GNU build system,
        using <application>autoconf</application> for package
        configuration and resolving portability issues,
        <application>automake</application> for building makefiles
        that comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
        <application>libtool</application> for building shared
        libraries on multiple platforms.  The normal sequence for
        compiling and installing the GLib library is thus:

        <literallayout>
          <userinput>./configure</userinput>
          <userinput>make</userinput>
          <userinput>make install</userinput>
        </literallayout>
      </para>

      <note>
        <title>Compiling on Mac OS X</title>
	<para>
	  On Mac OS X, it has been reported that internationalization support
	  in libiptcdata is often disabled at configure time because the
	  libintl library cannot be found.  However, this can usually be
	  remedied by pointing the configure script at the true location of
	  libintl by invoking it like this:
	  <literallayout>
	    <userinput>./configure --with-libintl-prefix=/sw --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw</userinput>
	  </literallayout>
	</para>
