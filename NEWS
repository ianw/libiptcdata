libiptcdata 0.2.1
=================
Released September 29, 2005

library:
* Added function iptc_data_set_version() to make it easy to set the version
number of the IPTC IIM spec being used.
* Added new convenience functions iptc_data_add_dataset_with_value() and
iptc_data_add_dataset_with_contents().

iptc utility:
* New capability to modify/delete/print specific datasets when more than one
of the same type exists, by appending the number to the end of the tag name.
For example, "Keywords:1" or "2:25:1" refer to keyword tag number 1 (the 2nd
keyword tag).
* New capability to modify/delete/print all datasets of a specific type when
more than one exists.  For example, "Keywords:all" or "2:25:all" will
execute the operation on all keyword tags.
* Dataset numbers (for duplicates) are now printed when the IPTC contents
are displayed to the user.
* Changed the semantics of the program's return value:  Success whenever at
least one operation succeeds and failure if no operation succeeds.
* Whenever a file is saved, datasets are now sorted by default unless the
--no-sort option is specified.
* Mac OS X compile fixes.
