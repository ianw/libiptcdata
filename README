DESCRIPTION
-----------

libiptcdata is a library for manipulating the International Press
Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata stored within multimedia
files such as images.  The library provides routines for parsing,
viewing, modifying, and saving this metadata.  The library is licensed
under the GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL).

The library implements the standard described at http://www.iptc.org/IIM

The code itself was inspired by the libexif library:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif, written by Lutz MÃ¼ller.
Together, libexif and libiptcdata provide a complete metadata
solution for image files.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

The current implementation of libiptcdata only supports extracting IPTC
data from JPEG files (although it can decode raw IPTC data from any
source as long as your application provides the data directly).  The
format for storing IPTC in JPEG files is a de-facto standard developed
by Adobe.
