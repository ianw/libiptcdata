Python wrapper for libiptcdata
 - Ian Wienand <ian@wienand.org>

OVERVIEW
========

The iptcdata module is a wrapper around libiptcdata designed for
updating IPTC information in JPEG files.  It can be enabled by passing
--enable-python to configure.  It will produce a module called
iptcdata.

An iptcdata.Data object holds a list of iptcdata.DataSet objects.
Values can be added and modified, but are only written back when the
Data object's save() function is called.  There are a handful of
functions to query record numbers, etc.

FILES
=====

 * pyiptcdatamod.c : module implementation
 * pyiptcdata.c    : iptcdata.Data object implementation
 * pyiptcdataset.c : iptcdata.DataSet object implementation
 * examples/*.py   : some example/test programs using the library

For simplicity, python3 has been forked and modified from the stable
python2 sources.  When building via automake, the top-level files will
include the correct version.  setup.py is included also for building
via setuptools.

NOTES
=====

Each DataSet object holds a reference to the Data object; only once
they are cleared will the Data object go away.  To handle the case
where references are held to a closed Data object, each object has a
state describing it's current validity.  Operations on objects in an
invalid state should raise an exception saying as much.
